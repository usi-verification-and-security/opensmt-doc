\section{Overview}

\opensmt~\cite{HyvarinenMAS16} is a T-DPLL based SMT
solver~\cite{NieuwenhuisOT:JACM06} that has been developed at USI,
Switzerland, since 2008.  The solver is written in {\tt C++} and
currently supports the quantifier-free logics of equality with
uninterpreted functions (\qfuf), linear real and integer arithmetic
(\qflra, \qflia), arrays (\qfax) and their combinations (\qfuflra, \qfuflia, \qfalia, \qfalra, \qfauflia, \qfauflra).
It has a specialized solver for real and integer difference logics (\qfrdl,
\qfidl). \opensmt also supports some aspects of bit-vector logic (\qfbv).

In comparison to 2022, the 2023 competition entry supports a combination of arrays with linear arithmetic and uninterpreted functions(\qfalia, \qfalra, \qfauflia, \qfauflra). 
Additionally, the lookahead engine of \opensmt now supports interpolation and incremental solving.
Performance of a lookahead engine has been improved with a new heuristic.

\opensmt features not exercised in the competition include support for a
wide range of interpolation algorithms for propositional
logic~\cite{AltFHS:VSTTE2015}, linear real
arithmetic~\cite{BlichaHKS19}, and uninterpreted
functions~\cite{AltHAS:FMCAD17} (available also in the incremental
mode); an experimental look\-ahead-based search
algorithm~\cite{HyvarinenMSCS18} as an alternative to the more standard
CDCL algorithm; and features that support search-space partitioning in
particular designed for parallel solving~\cite{HyvarinenMS:SAT15}.
\opensmt is now also able to efficiently produce proofs of
unsatisfiability~\cite{OtoniBEHS:DAC21}, although this feature is not merged to the main repository.

\section{Cloud and Parallel Solver}
The parallel version of \opensmt, called SMTS, runs on our parallelization infrastructure described in~\cite{MarescottiHS18}. The system is a client-server architecture that communicates with a custom protocol over TCP/IP. Parallel solving features include the complete implementation of the partition tree protocol with clause sharing. On a high level, the parallel solver partitions the instance dynamically on-demand and allows clauses to be shared between solvers working on different instances whenever this is allowed based on the information in the solvers. The dynamic partitioning is implemented as an iteration in a tree of consisting of partitioned instances, and the instances in inner nodes are considered equally to those in the leaves. This aproach guarantees under reasonable assumptions on the instanceâ€™s run time distribution that the parallel solver will not be slower than the sequential solver ~\cite{HyvarinenMS:SAT15}. For a fair and load-balanced scheduling of solving of the partitions, the solvers are distributed over the instances on parameters such as whether the instance has already been attempted, how many solvers are working on the instance, and how deep in the tree the instance is.

We support running the solver in the in AWS infrastructure, but it can also be run, e.g., in multi-core environments. We have entered two versions of the solver to the cloud and parallel tracks: SMTS portfolio which randomises the SAT solver by choosing 2\% of the decision variables randomly; and SMTS cube-and-conquer, which uses the parallelization tree~\cite{HyvarinenMS:SAT15} approach to implement a version of search-space-partitioning.

\section{External Code and Contributors}

The SAT solver driving \opensmt is based on the MiniSAT
solver~\cite{EenS:SAT03}, and the rational number implementation is

\section{Utilization}

\opensmt is used in a range of projects as a back-end solver.
Most notably, it is a basis for a new CHC solver Golem which scored among the top solvers
in LIA-Lin, LIA-Nonlin, and LRA-TS tracks in the last three editions of CHC-COMP~\cite{}
\opensmt also forms the basis of the model checkers HiFrog~\cite{AltACMFHS17} and
UpProver~\cite{Asadi_2020b}.
It was also used as an interpolation engine of the Sally model
checker~\cite{JovanovicD:FMCAD16}.

in chronological order, work on interpolation 
algorithms~\cite{BlichaHKS19,AltHAS17,JancikAFHKS16,AsadiBFHESC18}
and parallel SMT 
solving~\cite{HyvarinenMSCS18,MarescottiHS18,HyvarinenMS:SAT15}.
OpenSMT2 is
used as the back-end in model-checking tools
HiFrog~\cite{AltACMFHS17},
eVolCheck~\cite{FSS_TACAS13}, 
FunFrog~\cite{SFS_ATVA12}, and
PeRIPLO~\cite{RolliniAFHS:LPAR2013,AltFHS:VSTTE2015}.
OpenSMT2 is a supported engine in the parallel 
solving framework SMTS~\cite{MarescottiHS16}.
